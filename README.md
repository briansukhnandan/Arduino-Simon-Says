# Arduino Simon Says #

The classic children's game Simon Says on an Arduino! I decided to make this as sort of an inspirational tool to keep myself busy as the semester ended, and to keep my younger cousins in my house occupied on July 4th. Features use of a joystick mounted on
a rotating gyro to control the different LEDs that "Simon" may make use of, a single segment display to count the number of times the user had succeeded, which also decrements by 1 each time the user fails; I had also made use of
a passive buzzer, as it is capable of producing many notes in different octaves. I was able to make the buzzer sound like an 8-bit machine by applying a 220Î© resistor to it. 

# What I learned #
- The schematics of many more Arduino components.
- More use of digital logic to control the game and the components.
